<h2>Intro</h2>
<blockquote class="intro">
  "Harald and Svein first met as foes,<br>
  Where the Nis in the ocean flows;<br>
  For Svein would not for peace entreat,<br>
  But, strong in ships, would Harald meet.<br>
  The Norsemen prove, with sword in hand,<br>
  That numbers cannot skill withstand.<br>
  Off Halland's coast the blood of Danes<br>
  The blue sea's calm smooth surface stains."

<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Slaget vid Nissan ("The Battle of Niså") was a naval
  battle fought on 9 August 1062 between the forces of Norwegian
  king Harald Hardrada and king Sweyn II of Denmark.</p>

<p class="attribution"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Nis%C3%A5">From Wikipedia</a></p>

<!-- Harald had -->
<!--   claimed the Danish throne since 1047, and had launched raids -->
<!--   into Denmark ever since.</p> -->
<!-- <p>With his invasion in 1062, he wanted to decisively defeat the -->
<!--   Danes, and thus finally be able to conquer Denmark. The battle -->
<!--   was won clearly by the Norwegians, but since many Danes -->
<!--   managed to escape, including Sweyn, it proved indecisive in -->
<!--   Harald's attempt to conquer Denmark. -->
<!-- </p> -->

<p>With this tabletop miniatures game we're trying to recreate
  the battle itself, how it could have looked, and also if it
  could have ended in another way. The game will include a
  one-of-a-kind model of the coastal area outside of present-day
  city of Halmstad.
